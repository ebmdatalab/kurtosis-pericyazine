# Kurtosis and similar methods for identifying outliers in prescribing

This repo supports our paper "A hypothesis-free data science approach to identifying novel patterns of clinical interest in cliniciansâ€™ treatment preferences: clusters of high Pericyazine and Promazine use in England", which is [available as a preprint on MedRXiV](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.22.22272504v1) and is in the proces of being submitted for peer review. 

Here we looked for usual prescribing patterns across every chemical prescribed in England (using national GP prescribing data) and report illustrative results focusing on two antipsychotics, pericyazine and promazine. 

## How to view the results

Analysis and results are together in Jupyter notebooks. Notebooks live in the `notebooks/` folder (with an `ipynb` extension). You can most easily view them [on
nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ebmdatalab/<repo>/tree/master/notebooks/), though looking at them in Github should also work.

The main analysis is within [Kurtosis - pericyazine](https://github.com/ebmdatalab/kurtosis-pericyazine/blob/master/notebooks/Kurtosis%20-%20pericyazine.ipynb). Geographic maps showing usage across England are created in [CCG maps](https://github.com/ebmdatalab/kurtosis-pericyazine/blob/master/notebooks/CCG_maps.ipynb).
