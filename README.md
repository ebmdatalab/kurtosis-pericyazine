# Kurtosis and similar methods for identifying outliers in prescribing

This repo supports our paper looking for usual prescribing patterns across every chemical prescribed in England (using national GP prescribing data). We report illustrative results focusing on two antipsychotics, pericyazine and promazine. 

## How to view the results

Analysis and results are together in Jupyter notebooks. Notebooks live in the `notebooks/` folder (with an `ipynb` extension). You can most easily view them [on
nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ebmdatalab/<repo>/tree/master/notebooks/),
though looking at them in Github should also work.

The main analysis is within [Kurtosis - pericyazine](https://github.com/ebmdatalab/kurtosis-pericyazine/blob/tidying/notebooks/Kurtosis%20-%20pericyazine.ipynb). Geographic maps showing usage across England are created in [CCG maps](https://github.com/ebmdatalab/kurtosis-pericyazine/blob/tidying/notebooks/CCG_maps.ipynb).
